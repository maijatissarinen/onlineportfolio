# Online portfolio - Maija Tissarinen

This repository contains the source code for my personal online portfolio.

The portfolio is designed to give a clear overview of who I am and what are my skills.

## About me
I'm a master's student in computer science at Aalto University, majoring in Machine Learning, Data Science and Artificial intelligence, with a bachelor's degree in bioinformation technology.

My background combines data analysis, machine learning and information visualization. These skills allow me to turn raw data into understandable insights. I enjoy working on problems where data, technology and human needs meet, that is from analytical dashboards to intelligent applications.

I am currently looking for a summer position or thesis opportunity where I can apply data science and machine learning to real-world problems in industry or research.
